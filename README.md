## Onboarding guide for new maintainers

### For developers/maintainers who are not going to use Git for development
Creating local git repository for version control during the development is highly recommended. However, if you are not going to do that, you can also use Github web to download/upload files from/to the remote GitHub repositories. 

![Repositories communication for non-git user](https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta-dev/blob/design_doc/image/repositories_non_git_users.jpg)

#### Download files
You can go to [`Penncil/mmeta_dev`](https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta-dev) and then choose the target branch. Then you can download the source code or other documents as Zip files following the following instruction: [GitHub download zip](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/wiki/GitHub-download-zip).

#### Upload files:
To upload files, you can go to [`Penncil/mmeta_dev`](https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta-dev) or  [`Penncil/mmeta`](https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta) and then choose the target branch. Then you can download the source code or other documents as Zip files following the following instruction: 
* [Editing files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)
* [Adding a file to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository)






### For developers/maintainers who are going to use Git for development 
![Repositories communication for Git user](https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta-dev/blob/design_doc/image/repositories.jpg)
#### 1. Local setup and clone the  repositories

* step 1: create working directory <working_direcotory>  for the package, such as `d:/user/mmeta`. 

* step 2: add the two remote repositories by running the following git command in command line 
```
cd <working_direcotory>
git remote add public https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta.git
git remote add private https://github.com/Penncil/mmeta_dev.git
```
* step 3: clone the private repository run the following commands in terminal
```
git clone private 
```
#### 2. Switch branches


#### 3. Push to remote repositories






## Recommended workflow

### Release new version
* Step 1ï¼šPush all updates to `dev` branch on `Penncil/mmeta_dev`
* Step 2: merge `dev` branch to `main` branch on `Penncil/mmeta_dev`
* Step 3: push update to `Penncil/mmeta`
```
git push public main

```

* Step 4: release on `Penncil/mmeta`
Release new version : 
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository

* Step 5: release on CRAN
* Step 6: the information about the change in work_log:
